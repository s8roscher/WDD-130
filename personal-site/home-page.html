                <h1>Living for Adventure</h1>
                <h3>Experiences Makes Life Worth Living</h3>
                <p>Traveling around the world can really be eye opening to the joys, mysteries, and the lows of life. It gives us a greater appriciation for the lifes we lead today. From vactations to white beaches, to visiting grand cathidrals in the midst of victorian-style homes, vacations are unique to every person. <img id="friendly-faces" src="css/assets/images/Europe/england/DSC04452.jpg" alt="our family"> Some travel for knowledge, others travel for the beautiful views; but whatever you travel for, it can often be a stressful experience. Unfortunatly this stress can really take away from the traveling experience as a whole. Luckily, we're here to help take some of that stress away!</p>
                <p>My name is John, and this is my guide to traveling the world. Me, along with my wife and 3 daughters have been to well over half of the United States, and over 10 countries consisting of nations in Europe, North America, and South America.<img id="jjohnroscher" src="css/assets/images/jjohnroscher.jpg" alt="john roscher"> If there has been a popular desire to go there, we've been there. Here, I've shared my expereiences and favorite tourist locations to help you plan your own fun filled vacations.</p>
                <p>Take a look at a location that might interest you to see details about the sights to see and other fun experiences in the area! I also included some of my favorite places to eat and stay, since that can really make or break a vacation. The best part is that we know all the secrets to getting the most out of your adventures, like the best times to be places and even an optimal order of locations to spend as much time seeing things and having fun possible!</p>
